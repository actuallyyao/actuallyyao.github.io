Reading this book was quick and painless, just like blood drawing at a medical examination. You did it, not knowing what the result would be, if it&amp;rsquo;s important at all.
Almost a quarter of the book was abducted by the author&amp;rsquo;s uncanny interest in religious activities in the television era. Another quarter did remind me of the screen-centric age we&amp;rsquo;re living, though the screens now come in significantly smaller portions.</description>
